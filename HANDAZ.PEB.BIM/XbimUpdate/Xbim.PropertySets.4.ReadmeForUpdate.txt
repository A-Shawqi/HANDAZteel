XbimTeam have changed the approach to the Nuget packages ID.

Xbim.PropertySets.4 has been discontinued, but an alternative is available; the alternative package is called "Xbim.PropertySets".
To install it, you can proceed as follows:

Case 1: If you want to install Xbim.PropertySets support from scratch in your solution.
		Search and install the "Xbim.PropertySets" package instead.
		
Case 2: If you have already installed this version.
		Issue the following commands in the Package Manager Console window:
		
		Uninstall-Package Xbim.PropertySets.4 â€“Force	  
		
		Afterwards you should still have Xbim.PropertySets package in your solution.
		
You can safely delete this file and the XbimUpdate folder in your solution.
