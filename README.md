The project is simply an integrated expert system package for Pre-Engineered Buildings (PEB).  

It’s is intended to provide a full Pre-Engineered Buildings Package that is able to take customer inputs and automate the process of designing the steel PEB building.  It also allows the user to choose from different alternative designs, in order to meet customer’s needs and desires.



The system will not only save time for design companies, but it will minimize the human errors using an Expert System based on previous knowledge in the field.

In addition, the package will require less number of engineers to finish the designs which means less expanses and salaries, and thus making larger profits by giving the chance to the company to focus more on increasing the sales, rather than focusing on finishing different designs in time.

The Steel PEB Automation Package targets Steel Construction companies and structural engineers, and unlike current Design solutions, the Steel PEB Automation Package will not require but basic knowledge in Civil Engineering to generate a building design drawings and results. The Steel PEB Automation Package is intended to be a full solution that delivers and automate this process.



Scope:

•	To suggest different structural systems

•	To design secondary elements

•	To perform optimization processes, to minimize material scrap

•	To generate workshop drawings

•	To generate Estimate sheet and bill of materials



Assumptions and Dependencies:

DE-1: STAAD Pro Software

DE-2: SAP2000 Structural Analysis Software

DE-3: Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis Software

Our solution will be fully dependent to perform structural analysis and designs of any structural elements, however, modifications can be made to meet the desired outcome criteria.

In the future, we tend to use open source Analysis tool, to make the solution a stand-alone package.



Constraints
•	The software lacks stability and reliability when it comes to generating IFC files, due to some xBIM library bugs
